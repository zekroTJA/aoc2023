# AoC 2023 Solutions

Yeah, I'll try again on AoC this year. Let's see how far I will come without giving up in complete frustration.

> **Note**  
> I'll might change the code of previous day's solutions a bit afterwards for some refactoring and simplification of, for example, input and output processing. I will not change the code of the solution itself though.

This year, I am also trying to make a video on my German YouTube channel about every day's challenge. Feel free to take a look (if you speek German :D).

All solutions are published under the WTFPL, so like in good old school times, when you copy at least change the name. :)
